# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart PDF Toolkit is a comprehensive Python application that provides users with a complete suite of tools for PDF manipulation, analysis, and processing. The application aims to be a one-stop solution for all PDF-related activities, combining basic operations with advanced AI-powered features. The toolkit will serve both individual users who need occasional PDF processing and power users who require batch operations and advanced functionality.

The application will be designed with modularity in mind, allowing users to access functionality through multiple interfaces (GUI, CLI, and potentially web-based) while maintaining a consistent core feature set. The toolkit will emphasize ease of use, performance, and comprehensive functionality coverage.

6. IF OCR fails THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information and alternative processing options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to convert PDFs to and from other formats, so that I can work with PDF content in my preferred applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user converts PDF to images THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF) with quality options
2. WHEN a user converts images to PDF THEN the system SHALL create a properly formatted PDF with appropriate page sizing
3. WHEN a user converts PDF to Word/Excel THEN the system SHALL preserve formatting and structure as much as possible
4. WHEN a user converts HTML to PDF THEN the system SHALL render web content accurately including CSS styling
5. WHEN a user converts Office documents to PDF THEN the system SHALL maintain document formatting and embedded objects
6. IF conversion fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error information and suggest alternative approaches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to secure my PDFs with passwords and permissions, so that I can control access to sensitive documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds password protection THEN the system SHALL support both user passwords (for opening) and owner passwords (for permissions)
2. WHEN a user sets permissions THEN the system SHALL allow control over printing, copying, editing, and annotation rights
3. WHEN a user removes password protection THEN the system SHALL decrypt the PDF while preserving all content
4. WHEN a user adds digital signatures THEN the system SHALL create verifiable electronic signatures
5. WHEN a user adds watermarks THEN the system SHALL support both text and image watermarks with positioning options
6. IF security operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about permission or encryption issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to optimize and compress PDFs, so that I can reduce file sizes for sharing and storage while maintaining acceptable quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user compresses a PDF THEN the system SHALL offer multiple compression levels with size/quality trade-offs
2. WHEN a user optimizes for web THEN the system SHALL structure the PDF for fast web viewing and progressive loading
3. WHEN a user adjusts image quality THEN the system SHALL provide preview options to assess quality impact
4. WHEN a user optimizes fonts THEN the system SHALL embed or subset fonts as appropriate for file size reduction
5. WHEN a user converts color spaces THEN the system SHALL support RGB to CMYK conversion and other color space changes
6. IF optimization reduces quality significantly THEN the system SHALL warn the user and provide comparison options

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want batch processing capabilities, so that I can apply operations to multiple PDF files efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects multiple files for batch processing THEN the system SHALL apply the same operation to all selected files
2. WHEN batch processing is running THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and allow cancellation
